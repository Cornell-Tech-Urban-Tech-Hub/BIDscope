As a historic industrial district transformed into a thriving tech and creative hub, DUMBO suffers from extreme visitor concentration at a single photo location while many of its cultural and commercial assets remain underutilized. \r\n\r\nOur approach tackles this imbalance through strategic interventions that redistribute foot traffic, enhance the pedestrian experience, and activate underused public spaces. Based on interviews with residents, business owners, and visitors, we’ve developed solutions that benefit all stakeholders while preserving DUMBO’s distinctive character. \r\n\r\nOne of the project’s transformations is the DUMBO Discovery Trail, a self-guided walking path connecting scenic views, cultural landmarks, and local businesses throughout the district. Complemented by targeted streetscape enhancements and strategic activation of underutilized spaces, our plan creates a more balanced, engaging, and economically vibrant neighborhood experience. \r\n\r\nKey Facts: \r\n- Location: DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), Brooklyn, NY\r\nChallenge: 80% of visitors cluster at one photo spot (Washington St), straining infrastructure and limiting neighborhood exploration \r\n- Economic Context: Median income $163K (vs. NYC’s average of $55K)\r\n- Neighborhood Assets: Iconic bridge views, cobblestone streets, 140+ art studios/galleries, Brooklyn Tech Triangle anchor (1,000+ tech firms) \r\n- Project Goal: Disperse tourist traffic, enhance the pedestrian experience, and activate underused public space \r\n![overview](/public/components/groups/dumbo/overview.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Insight Analysis\r\n\r\nThrough interviews with tourists, local businesses, and visitors, research, and field visit to DUMBO, we observed a significant imbalance in how people experience the neighborhood, with most visitors gravitating to a single attraction while missing the area’s rich diversity. \r\n\r\nWashington Street’s famous Manhattan Bridge view has become a victim of its own Instagram success, creating severe bottlenecks that disrupt pedestrian flow and overwhelm local infrastructure. During peak hours, the concentration of tourists and photographers creates a congested environment that diminishes the experience for everyone. This over-concentration demonstrates a missed opportunity, as many visitors leave without experiencing DUMBO’s broader offerings. \r\n\r\n![washington](/public/components/groups/dumbo/Washington%20St.JPG)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, several potentially vibrant public spaces throughout the district sit underutilized. Areas like Dock Street, Anchorage Plaza, and the York Street subway entrance lack distinctive identity and programming, appearing as “dead zones” to visitors with no compelling reason to linger. These spaces have tremendous potential for activation through strategic interventions such as seating, public art, and temporary markets that could transform them into worthy destinations. \r\n\r\nThe absence of an intuitive wayfinding system compounds these issues. Without clear signage or suggested routes, visitors struggle to discover attractions beyond Washington Street. Cultural venues, local businesses, and alternative viewpoints remain hidden gems, unknown to most tourists who visit. This navigation challenge prevents organic exploration and limits economic benefits from spreading throughout the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nUltimately, DUMBO’s fundamental challenge is a disconnected visitor experience where scenic spots, shops, and cultural sites exist in isolation rather than as part of a cohesive journey. This fragmentation stems from a mismatch between the neighborhood’s potential (its diverse assets) and current perception (as a single-photo destination). Our interventions, therefore, focus on redistributing visitor density, enhancing physical and digital connectivity, and creating compelling reasons for exploration throughout the district. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Transformation Analysis\r\n\r\nBased on our insights, our transformation aims at addressing DUMBO’s issues of tourist congestion, underutilized public spaces, and fragmented visitor experiences. We proposed two main transformations: the DUMBO discovery trail and streetscape enhancements. \r\n\r\nThe first transformation is the creation of the DUMBO discovery trail. This is a self-guided walking path that links scenic views, cultural landmarks, small businesses, and art installations. The aim of this transformation is to disperse tourists beyond Washington Street by offering an intuitive, enriched, and more comprehensive exploration experience. There will be navigational signage and markers with QR codes to offer navigation assistance, historical context. There will also be seasonal themes (such as food, art, or heritage) that will encourage repeat visits. More importantly, the trail will also be integrated into major digital mapping platforms (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps), so visitors naturally encounter the trail when they open their apps in DUMBO. This multi-layered approach both physically and digitally weaves together DUMBO’s diverse attractions into a more cohesive journey that highlights DUMBO’s artistic characteristics and supports local business, while dispersing the tourist traffic on Washington Street. \r\n\r\nThe second transformation focuses on streetscape enhancements in underused areas such as Dock Street, Anchorage Plaza, Water & Adams Street, and the York Street Subway entrance. These spaces currently lack comfort, events, and do not look as appealing as other areas in DUMBO. The streetscape enhancements include widening sidewalks, adding seating, integrating more planters, and creating flexible open spaces for rotating public art, performances, and markets. The design language will draw from DUMBO’s industrial heritage, using cobblestones, and materials like weathered steel and bricks, to ensure that improvements reinforce the neighborhood’s unique industrial identity. Furthermore, the addition of more art pieces will help reinforce DUMBO’s identity as a creative district. The goal is to make these currently underutilized spaces more comfortable, visually cohesive, and attractive to both visitors and residents, effectively transforming “dead zones” into vibrant secondary destinations.\r\n\r\nTogether, these transformations aim to redistribute foot traffic across DUMBO, enhance visitor engagement, support local businesses, and reinforce the area’s cultural and historical character, creating a richer and more sustainable urban experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Prediction Analysis\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed crowd intervention strategies, we developed an agent-based simulation model using the GAMA platform to replicate tourist movement patterns in the DUMBO area. In the simulation, tourists enter the neighborhood from predefined entry points such as the subway station or Brooklyn Bridge, and proceed to explore the area based on their assigned behavioral profiles. Some tourists head directly to popular photo spots like the Manhattan Bridge, while others wander more randomly or follow interest-based paths. The model integrates real-world spatial data, including shapefiles for roads and buildings, and incorporates network-based pathfinding to ensure realistic movement along streets. By comparing scenarios with and without interventions—such as the addition of new attractions—we assessed the impact of these strategies on crowd distribution. The simulation results demonstrate that our intervention significantly dispersed tourist flows, reducing congestion at overly crowded landmarks and promoting a more balanced spatial distribution.\r\n\r\n# Consensus Analysis\r\n\r\n## Stakeholder Survey Engagement\r\nTo evaluate our transformation proposals with real stakeholders, we conducted on-site fieldwork in DUMBO again and asked 40 participants to do a survey. The participants included visitors, local business owners, and residents. The main part of the survey was to evaluate current and transformed spaces based on the before-and-after images. \r\n\r\nThe survey results strongly validated our design direction. Transformed locations consistently received higher appeal scores than their current state. For example, the Water & Adams area improvement shows the most dramatic increase (from 2.9 to 4.5 on a 5-point scale). The majority of participants expressed a preference for wandering and exploring different parts of DUMBO rather than visiting only the famous photo spot, supporting our Discovery Trail concept. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe also gained valuable insights into visitor types, with the data showing a diverse mix of sightseers (30.8%), culture and history enthusiasts (15.4%), food explorers (10.3%), and other categories that help calibrate our activation strategies. This real-world feedback provided empirical support for our hypothesis that visitors would enjoy a more distributed experience throughout DUMBO if appropriate infrastructure and wayfinding were in place. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe survey data will serve as a powerful communication tool in our broader consensus-building efforts. We can present visual preference results to the DUMBO BID and NYC agencies to demonstrate public support, share tourist type data with local businesses to highlight economic benefits, and use the findings as a baseline for continued engagement throughout implementation. \r\n\r\n## Broader Stakeholder Strategy\r\nBeyond our survey work, we identified key stakeholders whose input and support are essential for successful implementation, including: \r\n- DUMBO BID: Core implementation partner; coordinates with businesses, manages public space programming\r\n- NYC DOT & DCP: Infrastructure approvals, street design changes, signage, and sidewalk updates\r\n- Local Business Owners: Can help offer incentives, co-host events \r\n- Residents: Community stewards vital for long-term support and maintenance \r\n- Tourists & Visitors: End users whose behavior drives the success of the public space enhancements \r\n\r\nOur collaborative process will follow a four-stage approach: \r\n- Share & Visualize the Proposal: Present the Insight, Transformation, and Prediction narrative using visuals to make ideas clear for all audiences \r\n- Engage Stakeholders in Dialogue: Host workshops to gather input and surface priorities\r\n- Collect Public Feedback: Use QR codes, surveys, and comment boards at proposed sites\r\n- Prioritize & Adapt: Synthesize feedback to refine proposals and create a shared action plan \r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n- [DUMBO Improvement District Website](https://dumbo.org/)\r\n- [Annual Report (PDF)](https://dumbo.org/annual-reports/)\r\n- [NYC Small Business Services - BID Directory](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/business-improvement-districts.page)","src/content/projects/dumbo.md",[48],"../../assets/placeholder.jpg","71b43c5db101eff2",{"html":51,"metadata":52},"\u003Cp>Our project addresses the unique challenges facing one of Brooklyn’s most iconic neighborhoods.

Established in 1992, the BID supports approximately 500 businesses along a 1.5-mile stretch of 5th Avenue from Dean Street to 18th Street. The district is known for its eclectic mix of independent retailers, restaurants, and service businesses.\r\n\r\n# Insight Analysis\r\n\r\nTo obtain a better understanding of Park Slope's 5th Avenue, we interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders, including business owners, employees, long-time residents, and newcomers. Several key themes emerged from these conversations. Participants consistently highlighted Park Slope's supportive atmosphere for local enterprises. The walkable nature of the neighborhood was frequently mentioned as a significant asset. The varied population was cited as contributing to the area's unique character and appeal. Respondents also valued the gatherings that bring residents together and foster neighborhood cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Avenue BID strengthens community ties and supports local businesses through various initiatives. Annual family-friendly events include the holiday tree lighting at 4th Street Plaza and free children's workshops in partnership with organizations like the Textile Arts Center and Private Picassos. The BID also cultivates community partnerships, collaborating with the Park Slope Jewish Center on community projects and supporting local sustainability efforts.\r\n\r\nThese events serve multiple purposes. They attract foot traffic that boosts sales for local shops, cafes, and restaurants. They draw and retain residents who contribute to long-term local stability. Perhaps most importantly, they foster a sense of belonging and community pride that defines Park Slope's character.\r\n\r\n### Data-Driven Insights\r\nTo ground our work in local perspectives, we analyzed community-generated data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We performed Topic modeling analysis of hundreds of online reviews, testimonials, and social media posts related to 5th Avenue revealed recurring themes shown in Insight Visualization 1 (word clouds) and Insight Visualization 2 (pipeline).\r\n\r\nResidents and visitors frequently comment on 5th Avenue's active street life with vibrant pedestrian activity at various times of day. There's widespread appreciation for the diverse dining and retail options that line the avenue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, safety concerns became more prominent in community discussions, though many praised the area's resilience. The Open Streets initiative received positive reception, with many valuing these pedestrian-friendly spaces. In recent years, there's been increasing attention to green infrastructure and environmental practices, reflecting the community's forward-thinking values and growing recognition of climate vulnerabilities that threaten both businesses and residential areas. \r\n\r\n\r\n### COVID & Open Streets\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the residents and business owners of Park Slope faced many hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. We spoke to Brooklynites about the impact. Many small businesses struggled to keep up revenue & pay rent. For some, financial hardship lead them to closing permanently. However, the Open Streets Program transformed sections of 5th Avenue into pedestrian-friendly zones and allowed for outdoor dining helped local businesses sustain revenue. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Open Streets Program has faced issues securing funding for some years. When the program was revoked in March 2024, 5th Avenue merchants formed their own association, partnering with New York Presbyterian Hospital, U. Santini Moving & Storage, and the NYC Department of Transportation. While they were only approved for a scaled-down version, with a reduced footprint from 16 blocks to 4 blocks, operating every Saturday from May to November. Nonetheless, 5th Avenue continues to push for policies that support affordability and long-term sustainability for Park Slope’s independent businesses.\r\n\r\n### The Climate Imperative\r\n\r\nThe community's increasing focus on sustainability and environmental practices has proven especially crucial as Park Slope faces growing climate challenges. Beyond aesthetic improvements, these environmental concerns have become an existential priority for the neighborhood's businesses and residents alike.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, this particular area in Brooklyn has seen severe flooding instances. Joanna Tallantire, Executive Director of the Park Slope Fifth Avenue BID, was quoted in the Brooklyn Paper in 2023: “...over 30 businesses on 5th Avenue in Park Slope experienced up to six feet of water in their basements, destroying equipment and inventory” (Fishman). This severe flooding caused substantial damage to businesses within the BID. The overwhelmed local infrastructure eventually led to projects that aim to combat and prevent flooding in Park Slope. For example, The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has since installed \"...70 curbside rain gardens and Green Infrastructure playgrounds at P.S. 282 in Park Slope and P.S. 38 in Boerum Hill...allowing stormwater to be naturally absorbed into the ground, thereby keeping it out of the sewer system where it could contribute to flooding and overflows into the Canal\" (DEP). This approach notes the curvature of the land in Park Slope. From prior reports, it is clear that flooding is far more severe near the Gowanus Canal as well as near 3rd and 4th Avenues. However, 5th Avenue sits atop the slope. Focusing on preventing stormwater runoff from reaching the lower avenues can allow for less flooding altogether. \r\n\r\nIn October 2024, “Vice President Kamala Harris, as part of the Biden administration, supported one of the largest federal investments in cleaning up legacy pollution through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which earmarked $3.5 billion toward environmental remediation at Superfund sites” (EPA). The Gowanus Canal was also listed as a Superfund Site. In November 2024, the NYC Department of Design and Construction completed a $40.7 million project in Park Slope, replacing over 1.6 miles of older water mains and upgrading local combined sewers to improve stormwater drainage (NYC BERS). Later, in January 2025, $160 million in federal funding was secured to enhance climate resiliency efforts across New York City, including areas like Park Slope. (Brooklyn Eagle). \r\n\r\nOur research uncovered numerous multi-million and even billion-dollar projects aimed at flood mitigation and strengthening climate resilience. However, none were aimed at mitigating rainfall that trickled down from 5th avenue to avenues with lower altitudes. From this, we noticed an opportunity with intercepting and managing water before it reaches 4th Avenue and below. \r\n\r\n# Transformation Analysis\r\n\r\nIn an effort to aid the issues we’ve mentioned so far, we propose assisting in flood prevention methods while also redesigning streets to accommodate and encourage the Open Streets Initiative. \r\n\r\nThere is a range of improvements we can make to 5th Avenue that will allow it to become a proactive area for flood mitigation. Expanding rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable surfaces to absorb excess rainwater naturally can aid in green stormwater management. As shown in Transformation Visualization, we used Streetmix to show some examples of improvements (discussed further). Installing strategic water catchment areas to prevent overflow into vulnerable streets via retention basins and flood barriers can further contribite to flood prevention. Lastly, using sensors and real-time monitoring to optimize water flow and prevent backups via smart drainaige systems can assure that sewers do not go beyong their capacity. \r\n\r\nTo fund improvements, we suggest reallocating a portion of the Gowanus Canal Superfund investment toward upstream flood prevention, especially on 5th Avenue because keeping water from reaching 4th Avenue now will reduce future remediation costs downstream. We also see potential in local revenue tools, like shoreline protection districts, targeted taxes, or partnerships with the insurance industry where insurers could invest in risk reduction that directly benefits their bottom line. We suggest a public-private partnership model. Local businesses, whose storefronts and operations are directly affected by flooding could co-fund the project, while federal Superfund dollars would match private contributions.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, transforming community outreach by partnering with more public schools to install rain gardens, launching a “Resilient Open Streets” model where public funding supports community-led maintenance, and adding educational signage will help residents understand and contribute to flood mitigation efforts. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Prediction Analysis\r\n\r\n###  Flooding Sources – 5th Avenue BID\r\n\r\nWhile 5th Avenue sits at a higher elevation, GAMA simulations and community input reveal that the corridor remains vulnerable to several systemic flood risks:\r\n\r\n- **Stormwater Runoff (High Risk)**  \r\n  The natural slope of Park Slope funnels rainwater downhill. Without sufficient green infrastructure, 5th Avenue channels excess water toward lower avenues, especially during heavy rain events.\r\n\r\n- **Combined Sewer Backflow (Medium Risk)**  \r\n  During high-intensity storms, NYC’s combined sewer system can overflow. GAMA models indicate potential for basement-level flooding along 5th Avenue through backflow in drainage lines.\r\n\r\n- **Insufficient Onsite Absorption (High Risk)**  \r\n  GAMA simulations highlight the lack of permeable surfaces and bioswales, showing minimal water retention on-site. This exacerbates runoff and reduces flood buffering capacity.\r\n\r\n- **Lateral Spillover from Adjacent Areas (Low–Medium Risk)**  \r\n  Severe flooding in lower zones (like 4th Ave and near Gowanus) can extend laterally via intersecting side streets, creating secondary risks for the BID area.\r\n\r\n>  **GAMA Insight:**  \r\n> Under high-risk scenarios, cells around 5th Avenue show increasing water height over time, especially in areas near side streets and drains. Without interventions, simulations project overflow cascading from elevated areas into low-lying zones — a problem preventable with upstream retention.\r\n\r\n> *Conclusion: Preventing flooding on 5th Avenue is less about direct rainfall and more about managing how the corridor interacts with larger urban drainage systems. GAMA confirms that targeted interventions—bioswales, permeable sidewalks, and smart drainage—can intercept runoff and protect both 5th Avenue and downstream neighborhoods.*\r\n\r\n\r\nOur analysis utilizes three complementary simulation tools to evaluate different scenarios for 5th Avenue and their impact on the broader Park Slope area:\r\n\r\n- StreetMix: Measures changes in foot traffic, flood prevention effectiveness, and traffic congestion based on different street configurations.  \r\n- FloodNet: Visualizes flooding patterns from the Gowanus Canal during major storm events, based on elevation data.  \r\n- GAMA: Models localized flooding from rainfall and storms showing water diffusion and barrier effectiveness. GAMA depicts generic flooding behavior across the terrain, regardless of whether water originates from rainfall, canal overflow, or runoff.\r\n\r\nWe modeled three distinct scenarios to assess potential interventions:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FloodNet Elevation Map in Prediction Visualization 1 clearly illustrates the topographical reality of Park Slope - a neighborhood that truly lives up to its name. The color gradient shows how 5th Avenue sits at a significantly higher elevation (depicted in orange-yellow tones) compared to the progressively lower-lying areas to the west. The Gowanus Canal and its immediate surroundings (shown in blue-green) represent the lowest points in the area.\r\n\r\nThe Flood Vulnerability Map in Prediction Visualization 2 demonstrates the direct consequences of this elevation differential. Areas along the Gowanus Canal and 3rd Avenue display high vulnerability to flooding (indicated by the intense red zones), while vulnerability gradually decreases as elevation increases eastward toward 5th Avenue. This clear visual correlation between elevation and flood risk validates our upstream intervention approach.\r\n\r\nBy implementing water management solutions at 5th Avenue's higher elevation, we can intercept rainwater before it naturally flows downhill, preventing the accumulation of stormwater in the more vulnerable lower-lying areas. This preventative strategy addresses flooding at its source rather than merely reacting to flooding events after they've occurred in the canal area.\r\n\r\n### View 1: Average Flooding/Baseline Scenario\r\nThis view represents the current state of 5th Avenue with existing infrastructure and typical flooding patterns.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003Cimg\r\n  src=\"../../../public/components/groups/fifth-ave-brooklyn/average_streetmix.png\"\r\n  alt=\"Figure 1.

GAMA View 3: Reduced Flooding Scenario\u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe GAMA simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention:\r\n\r\n- BID area and surroundings are affected by increased water levels\r\n- Vegetation (green patches) appear as water recedes and cells near the BID\r\n- The intervention successfully manages the water that would otherwise flow downhill\r\n\r\nThe aerial view shows reduced blue coloration in lower areas, indicating that the 5th Avenue interventions are successfully intercepting and managing stormwater before it can accumulate downstream.\r\n\r\n### Key Findings\r\n\r\nThe intervention scenario demonstrating reduced funding shows that strategic modifications to 5th Avenue can have dual benefits: improved business conditions through enhanced foot traffic and aesthetics, alongside significant flood prevention capacity that protects not just 5th Avenue but the downstream neighborhoods as well.\r\n\r\nFirstly, upstream flood prevention is critical and effective. Our simulations validate that targeted green infrastructure along 5th Avenue—Park Slope's higher-elevation commercial spine—can significantly intercept and manage stormwater. By addressing runoff at the source, these interventions protect more vulnerable low-lying areas like 4th Avenue and the Gowanus Canal from severe flooding.\r\n\r\nNotably, these changes leverage the momentum of the Open Streets initiative, which already reimagines parts of 5th Avenue as a more pedestrian-friendly space. While the redesign introduces disruption—shifting the corridor’s balance away from car traffic—it aligns with a broader citywide vision for accessible, community-first streetscapes. In this context, 5th Avenue becomes a testbed for resilient urban design, where stormwater solutions integrate naturally into public space upgrades.\r\n\r\nBeyond flood mitigation, the proposed interventions also yield strong community and economic co-benefits. Enhanced streetscapes with widened sidewalks, tree canopy, and permeable surfaces transform 5th Avenue into a greener, more inviting corridor. This attracts foot traffic, increases dwell time, and boosts retail activity—directly benefiting local businesses participating in or adjacent to the Open Streets program.\r\n\r\nEven with these transformations, traffic flow remains resilient. StreetMix models show that despite the introduction of bioswales, rain gardens, and pedestrian zones, vehicular disruptions are modest and remain within a manageable 10% threshold. This confirms the feasibility of integrating climate adaptation features without sacrificing transportation performance.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this is about more than risk mitigation—it’s about community-building. A redesigned 5th Avenue becomes a climate asset and a cultural one: a model for how urban corridors can embrace sustainability without losing identity. It offers Park Slope and surrounding areas not just protection, but pride and permanence in the face of climate change.\r\n\r\n# Consensus Analysis\r\n\r\nAchieving consensus on upstream flood prevention and green infrastructure redesign hinges on coordinated action across a diverse network of stakeholders. As shown in Consensus Visualization, core agencies like the DEP, DDC, DOT, and EPA are already engaged in parallel efforts, from stormwater management to Superfund remediation. Their technical expertise and regulatory authority make them essential partners in implementing infrastructure changes along 5th Avenue. At the same time, civic tech groups and academic experts provide critical support for modeling and analysis, while insurers represent a promising avenue for co-funding through risk reduction strategies.\r\n\r\nEqually important are the community voices shaping and experiencing these changes firsthand. Residents, school leaders, and business owners along 4th and 5th Avenues are not only impacted by flooding but also stand to benefit most from a greener, more resilient corridor. Organizations like the Fifth Avenue BID and Gowanus Canal Conservancy bridge institutional and local knowledge, ensuring our interventions reflect both environmental science and neighborhood priorities. Through targeted outreach—policy briefs for officials, hands-on workshops for residents, and collaborative dashboards for experts—we’re building shared understanding and mutual investment. Consensus here isn’t uniform agreement; it’s a shared framework where every group has tools to visualize, evaluate, and act on a better future.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [5th Avenue BID Website](https://parkslopefifthavenuebid.com/)\r\n- [Annual Report (PDF)](https://parkslopefifthavenuebid.com/annual-reports/)\r\n- [NYC Small Business Services - BID Directory](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/business-improvement-districts.page)\r\n- [5th Avenue Streetmix](https://streetmix.net//2882362) (Streetmix.net, 2025).

Established in 1992, the BID supports approximately 500 businesses along a 1.5-mile stretch of 5th Avenue from Dean Street to 18th Street. The district is known for its eclectic mix of independent retailers, restaurants, and service businesses.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"insight-analysis\">Insight Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>To obtain a better understanding of Park Slope’s 5th Avenue, we interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders, including business owners, employees, long-time residents, and newcomers. Several key themes emerged from these conversations. Participants consistently highlighted Park Slope’s supportive atmosphere for local enterprises. The walkable nature of the neighborhood was frequently mentioned as a significant asset. The varied population was cited as contributing to the area’s unique character and appeal. Respondents also valued the gatherings that bring residents together and foster neighborhood cohesion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Fifth Avenue BID strengthens community ties and supports local businesses through various initiatives. Annual family-friendly events include the holiday tree lighting at 4th Street Plaza and free children’s workshops in partnership with organizations like the Textile Arts Center and Private Picassos. The BID also cultivates community partnerships, collaborating with the Park Slope Jewish Center on community projects and supporting local sustainability efforts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These events serve multiple purposes. They attract foot traffic that boosts sales for local shops, cafes, and restaurants. They draw and retain residents who contribute to long-term local stability. Perhaps most importantly, they foster a sense of belonging and community pride that defines Park Slope’s character.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"data-driven-insights\">Data-Driven Insights\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>To ground our work in local perspectives, we analyzed community-generated data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We performed Topic modeling analysis of hundreds of online reviews, testimonials, and social media posts related to 5th Avenue revealed recurring themes shown in Insight Visualization 1 (word clouds) and Insight Visualization 2 (pipeline).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Residents and visitors frequently comment on 5th Avenue’s active street life with vibrant pedestrian activity at various times of day. There’s widespread appreciation for the diverse dining and retail options that line the avenue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, safety concerns became more prominent in community discussions, though many praised the area’s resilience. The Open Streets initiative received positive reception, with many valuing these pedestrian-friendly spaces. In recent years, there’s been increasing attention to green infrastructure and environmental practices, reflecting the community’s forward-thinking values and growing recognition of climate vulnerabilities that threaten both businesses and residential areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"covid--open-streets\">COVID &#x26; Open Streets\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>On the other hand, the residents and business owners of Park Slope faced many hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. We spoke to Brooklynites about the impact. Many small businesses struggled to keep up revenue &#x26; pay rent. For some, financial hardship lead them to closing permanently. However, the Open Streets Program transformed sections of 5th Avenue into pedestrian-friendly zones and allowed for outdoor dining helped local businesses sustain revenue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unfortunately, the Open Streets Program has faced issues securing funding for some years. When the program was revoked in March 2024, 5th Avenue merchants formed their own association, partnering with New York Presbyterian Hospital, U. Santini Moving &#x26; Storage, and the NYC Department of Transportation. While they were only approved for a scaled-down version, with a reduced footprint from 16 blocks to 4 blocks, operating every Saturday from May to November. Nonetheless, 5th Avenue continues to push for policies that support affordability and long-term sustainability for Park Slope’s independent businesses.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-climate-imperative\">The Climate Imperative\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The community’s increasing focus on sustainability and environmental practices has proven especially crucial as Park Slope faces growing climate challenges. Beyond aesthetic improvements, these environmental concerns have become an existential priority for the neighborhood’s businesses and residents alike.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In recent years, this particular area in Brooklyn has seen severe flooding instances. Joanna Tallantire, Executive Director of the Park Slope Fifth Avenue BID, was quoted in the Brooklyn Paper in 2023: “…over 30 businesses on 5th Avenue in Park Slope experienced up to six feet of water in their basements, destroying equipment and inventory” (Fishman). This severe flooding caused substantial damage to businesses within the BID. The overwhelmed local infrastructure eventually led to projects that aim to combat and prevent flooding in Park Slope. For example, The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has since installed “…70 curbside rain gardens and Green Infrastructure playgrounds at P.S. 282 in Park Slope and P.S. 38 in Boerum Hill…allowing stormwater to be naturally absorbed into the ground, thereby keeping it out of the sewer system where it could contribute to flooding and overflows into the Canal” (DEP). This approach notes the curvature of the land in Park Slope. From prior reports, it is clear that flooding is far more severe near the Gowanus Canal as well as near 3rd and 4th Avenues. However, 5th Avenue sits atop the slope. Focusing on preventing stormwater runoff from reaching the lower avenues can allow for less flooding altogether.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In October 2024, “Vice President Kamala Harris, as part of the Biden administration, supported one of the largest federal investments in cleaning up legacy pollution through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which earmarked $3.5 billion toward environmental remediation at Superfund sites” (EPA). The Gowanus Canal was also listed as a Superfund Site. In November 2024, the NYC Department of Design and Construction completed a $40.7 million project in Park Slope, replacing over 1.6 miles of older water mains and upgrading local combined sewers to improve stormwater drainage (NYC BERS). Later, in January 2025, $160 million in federal funding was secured to enhance climate resiliency efforts across New York City, including areas like Park Slope. (Brooklyn Eagle).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our research uncovered numerous multi-million and even billion-dollar projects aimed at flood mitigation and strengthening climate resilience. However, none were aimed at mitigating rainfall that trickled down from 5th avenue to avenues with lower altitudes. From this, we noticed an opportunity with intercepting and managing water before it reaches 4th Avenue and below.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"transformation-analysis\">Transformation Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>In an effort to aid the issues we’ve mentioned so far, we propose assisting in flood prevention methods while also redesigning streets to accommodate and encourage the Open Streets Initiative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is a range of improvements we can make to 5th Avenue that will allow it to become a proactive area for flood mitigation. Expanding rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable surfaces to absorb excess rainwater naturally can aid in green stormwater management. As shown in Transformation Visualization, we used Streetmix to show some examples of improvements (discussed further). Installing strategic water catchment areas to prevent overflow into vulnerable streets via retention basins and flood barriers can further contribite to flood prevention. Lastly, using sensors and real-time monitoring to optimize water flow and prevent backups via smart drainaige systems can assure that sewers do not go beyong their capacity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To fund improvements, we suggest reallocating a portion of the Gowanus Canal Superfund investment toward upstream flood prevention, especially on 5th Avenue because keeping water from reaching 4th Avenue now will reduce future remediation costs downstream. We also see potential in local revenue tools, like shoreline protection districts, targeted taxes, or partnerships with the insurance industry where insurers could invest in risk reduction that directly benefits their bottom line. We suggest a public-private partnership model. Local businesses, whose storefronts and operations are directly affected by flooding could co-fund the project, while federal Superfund dollars would match private contributions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And lastly, transforming community outreach by partnering with more public schools to install rain gardens, launching a “Resilient Open Streets” model where public funding supports community-led maintenance, and adding educational signage will help residents understand and contribute to flood mitigation efforts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"prediction-analysis\">Prediction Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"flooding-sources--5th-avenue-bid\">Flooding Sources – 5th Avenue BID\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>While 5th Avenue sits at a higher elevation, GAMA simulations and community input reveal that the corridor remains vulnerable to several systemic flood risks:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Stormwater Runoff (High Risk)\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nThe natural slope of Park Slope funnels rainwater downhill.

Our simulations validate that targeted green infrastructure along 5th Avenue—Park Slope’s higher-elevation commercial spine—can significantly intercept and manage stormwater. By addressing runoff at the source, these interventions protect more vulnerable low-lying areas like 4th Avenue and the Gowanus Canal from severe flooding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Notably, these changes leverage the momentum of the Open Streets initiative, which already reimagines parts of 5th Avenue as a more pedestrian-friendly space. While the redesign introduces disruption—shifting the corridor’s balance away from car traffic—it aligns with a broader citywide vision for accessible, community-first streetscapes. In this context, 5th Avenue becomes a testbed for resilient urban design, where stormwater solutions integrate naturally into public space upgrades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Beyond flood mitigation, the proposed interventions also yield strong community and economic co-benefits. Enhanced streetscapes with widened sidewalks, tree canopy, and permeable surfaces transform 5th Avenue into a greener, more inviting corridor. This attracts foot traffic, increases dwell time, and boosts retail activity—directly benefiting local businesses participating in or adjacent to the Open Streets program.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even with these transformations, traffic flow remains resilient. StreetMix models show that despite the introduction of bioswales, rain gardens, and pedestrian zones, vehicular disruptions are modest and remain within a manageable 10% threshold. This confirms the feasibility of integrating climate adaptation features without sacrificing transportation performance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ultimately, this is about more than risk mitigation—it’s about community-building. A redesigned 5th Avenue becomes a climate asset and a cultural one: a model for how urban corridors can embrace sustainability without losing identity. It offers Park Slope and surrounding areas not just protection, but pride and permanence in the face of climate change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"consensus-analysis\">Consensus Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Achieving consensus on upstream flood prevention and green infrastructure redesign hinges on coordinated action across a diverse network of stakeholders. As shown in Consensus Visualization, core agencies like the DEP, DDC, DOT, and EPA are already engaged in parallel efforts, from stormwater management to Superfund remediation. Their technical expertise and regulatory authority make them essential partners in implementing infrastructure changes along 5th Avenue. At the same time, civic tech groups and academic experts provide critical support for modeling and analysis, while insurers represent a promising avenue for co-funding through risk reduction strategies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Equally important are the community voices shaping and experiencing these changes firsthand. Residents, school leaders, and business owners along 4th and 5th Avenues are not only impacted by flooding but also stand to benefit most from a greener, more resilient corridor. Organizations like the Fifth Avenue BID and Gowanus Canal Conservancy bridge institutional and local knowledge, ensuring our interventions reflect both environmental science and neighborhood priorities. Through targeted outreach—policy briefs for officials, hands-on workshops for residents, and collaborative dashboards for experts—we’re building shared understanding and mutual investment. Consensus here isn’t uniform agreement; it’s a shared framework where every group has tools to visualize, evaluate, and act on a better future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"references\">References\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://parkslopefifthavenuebid.com/\">5th Avenue BID Website\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://parkslopefifthavenuebid.com/annual-reports/\">Annual Report (PDF)\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/business-improvement-districts.page\">NYC Small Business Services - BID Directory\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://streetmix.net//2882362\">5th Avenue Streetmix\u003C/a> (Streetmix.net, 2025).

Located on the western edge of Queens directly across from Midtown Manhattan, Long Island City has undergone a remarkable transformation from an industrial center to a vibrant mixed-use district. The BID supports a diverse array of businesses, cultural institutions, and an expanding residential population. With its distinctive waterfront, world-class arts organizations like MoMA PS1, and rapidly changing skyline, Long Island City represents one of the most dramatic urban transformations in recent New York City history.\r\n\r\n# Insight Analysis\r\n\r\nLong Island City (LIC) is a vibrant, rapidly developing neighborhood in Queens that functions as a major transportation hub with excellent connectivity through 8 subway lines, 15 bus lines, 3 ferry landings, and numerous other transit options. Originally established in 2005, the Long Island City Business Improvement District (LIC BID) has undergone strategic expansions in 2017 and now in 2025, tripling its coverage area to serve the growing needs of this dynamic community.\r\n\r\nThe 2025 expansion and also our BID transformation aim to address a critical problem identified in the expansion areas: lack of visibility and community engagement. This expansion aims to bring much-needed services to previously underserved areas that have seen increasing foot traffic and commercial activity, with former side streets now functioning as main streets requiring dedicated support and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood features diverse assets including educational institutions, cultural venues, office spaces, creative workshops, food production facilities, and community recreation areas. Key stakeholders in this expansion include business owners in the expansion area, nearby residents, visitors (primarily from within the city), LIC Partnership operation officials, municipal departments, and potential investors.\r\n\r\nData analysis of the area reveals significant foot traffic patterns along major corridors, with pedestrian density simulations highlighting key intersection points that would benefit from activation. The expansion builds upon LIC's established identity as a cultural hotspot with numerous galleries, museums, and performance spaces that have transformed the neighborhood from its industrial roots into a vibrant arts destination.\r\n\r\n# Transformation Analysis\r\n\r\nThe transformation strategy for the LIC BID expansion area builds on successful models already proven in the other part of LIC, particularly drawing inspiration from Culture Lab LIC. This cultural hub transformed a once-industrial block into a vibrant community center, demonstrating how temporary venues can establish lasting identity and activity. Culture Lab LIC serves as a scalable model for cultural infrastructure, attracting over 1,000 attendees per weekend, generating $785K+ in annual revenue, supporting 20+ artist residencies yearly, and maintaining 30+ community partnerships.\r\n\r\nDrawing from the successful experience in LIC, our proposed intervention format centers around pop-up events—temporary, multi-functional public spaces (street corners and parking lots) strategically located in underutilized areas. These pop-ups offer several advantages: they are pilot-friendly and easy to iterate, temporary by design, low-risk yet high-impact, and serve as bridges to future planning by opening pathways for long-term interventions without requiring permanent infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAn innovative \"LIC BID Pop-up Event Location Selection Tool\" has been developed using path-based multi-criteria decision analysis to identify optimal parking lot locations for these events. The tool evaluates 54 potential parking lots based on subway accessibility, housing proximity, biking infrastructure, POI proximity, and traffic flow, creating a comprehensive scoring system that optimizes for community impact.\r\n\r\nThe transformation combines \"hard\" and \"soft\" system elements. The hard system includes building physical pop-up cultural and market plazas featuring local art installations, food truck areas, live performances, and interactive wayfinding. The soft system provides digital and institutional support through website promotion, social media engagement, and the integration of an existing LIC Community E-Gift Card program that connects over 100 participating businesses.\r\n\r\n# Prediction Analysis\r\n\r\nTo understand the potential impacts of our pop-up interventions, we analyzed two key scenarios: a mini market featuring local food and crafts, and an art installation designed to encourage walkability and increase dwell time in the area. Our analysis shows that each intervention creates different but complementary impacts. The mini market generates peak activity during lunch hours, with visitors staying 8-12 minutes on average and spending approximately $15-25 per visit. Meanwhile, art installations attract after-work crowds and weekend family visits, with shorter dwell times but contribute to area awareness through social media engagement.\r\n\r\nThese immediate effects cascade into broader impacts. Immediately after visiting, awareness of the area begins to grow through multiple channels – from new social media followers and newsletter signups to geo-tagged posts and community survey responses. This digital engagement has already generated 40% year-over-year growth on Instagram for similar initiatives. The pop-up economy creates several economic benefits: boosting nearby retail revenue, providing direct income for vendors, creating spillover sales for permanent businesses, potential job creation in both temporary and permanent roles, and opportunities to link with grant programs for long-term support. Market research indicates that while the monthly rent for retail space averages $24.92 per square foot in the area, these temporary activations can operate for just 3-14 days while creating outsized impact.\r\n\r\nBy activating these spaces, the pop-up events will increase foot traffic, participation and engagement, boost local business revenue, create economic impact through job creation and tax revenue, enhance perceived safety, and strengthen neighborhood identity. This data-driven approach ensures targeted interventions that maximize return on investment while building community support for the expansion initiative.\r\n\r\n# Consensus Analysis\r\n\r\nOur consensus-building approach creates a collaborative framework where stakeholders with diverse interests work together toward shared goals through transparent processes, inclusive participation, and iterative refinement that adapts to changing conditions and feedback. This process recognizes that different stakeholders have varying interests, influence, and preferred communication methods, requiring tailored engagement strategies. For groups like local business owners and residents, we employ accessible methods including community workshops, social media engagement, and direct participation in pop-up events.\r\n\r\nOur multi-channel strategy utilizes both active input methods (interviews, workshops, comments, feedback forms) and passive data collection (foot traffic analysis, social media engagement, participation metrics, economic data, platform analytics) to create a comprehensive understanding of what stakeholders both say they want and how they actually behave when interventions are implemented. For example, we can observe which pop-up events generate the most engagement, analyze spending patterns through the LIC gift card program, and track how interventions affect visitor dwell time, creating a more complete picture of stakeholder preferences and identifying opportunities that might be missed through traditional engagement alone.\r\n\r\nOur consensus process preserves existing cultural assets by implementing a local-first policy that prioritizes existing businesses in pop-up opportunities, giving them the first chance to benefit from increased visibility. This ensures we protect what makes LIC unique while enhancing its connectivity and appeal.\r\n\r\nWe've established a clear evolution path that transforms temporary interventions into permanent improvements over time:\r\n- Phase 1 (1-3 months): Pop-up phase with temporary installations requiring minimal infrastructure\r\n- Phase 2 (3-12 months): Seasonal programming with recurring events and light infrastructure\r\n- Phase 3 (1-2 years): Semi-permanent installations with more substantial physical improvements\r\n- Phase 4 (2+ years): Permanent transformation with full implementation of successful elements\r\n\r\nAt each stage, we evaluate success through multiple metrics: economic indicators like business revenue and occupancy rates; social measures including event participation and resident satisfaction; visibility metrics such as social media mentions and visitor numbers; and sustainability factors including operational costs and environmental impact. This phased approach builds consensus through shared experience rather than abstract plans, reducing risk while allowing the community to shape the area's future organically.\r\n\r\nTo make this consensus process practical and accessible, we've developed an interactive Streamlit tool that serves as both a communication platform and a decision-making framework. The platform allows stakeholders to explore potential interventions and their impacts, and captures distributed input from participants regardless of when or where they engage. By integrating data from our previous analysis phases, it helps stakeholders understand the potential consequences of different choices while fostering a sense of ownership and investment in the expansion's success.\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n- [Long Island City Partnership Website](https://longislandcityqueens.com/)\r\n- [Annual Report (PDF)](https://longislandcityqueens.com/about/annual-reports/)\r\n- [NYC Small Business Services - BID Directory](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/business-improvement-districts.page)","src/content/projects/long-island-city.md",[246],"../../assets/lic.png","2882d5d3d9df3f17",{"html":249,"metadata":250},"\u003Cp>The Long Island City Partnership serves one of New York City’s fastest-growing and most dynamic neighborhoods. Located on the western edge of Queens directly across from Midtown Manhattan, Long Island City has undergone a remarkable transformation from an industrial center to a vibrant mixed-use district. The BID supports a diverse array of businesses, cultural institutions, and an expanding residential population. With its distinctive waterfront, world-class arts organizations like MoMA PS1, and rapidly changing skyline, Long Island City represents one of the most dramatic urban transformations in recent New York City history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"insight-analysis\">Insight Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Long Island City (LIC) is a vibrant, rapidly developing neighborhood in Queens that functions as a major transportation hub with excellent connectivity through 8 subway lines, 15 bus lines, 3 ferry landings, and numerous other transit options. Originally established in 2005, the Long Island City Business Improvement District (LIC BID) has undergone strategic expansions in 2017 and now in 2025, tripling its coverage area to serve the growing needs of this dynamic community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The 2025 expansion and also our BID transformation aim to address a critical problem identified in the expansion areas: lack of visibility and community engagement. This expansion aims to bring much-needed services to previously underserved areas that have seen increasing foot traffic and commercial activity, with former side streets now functioning as main streets requiring dedicated support and infrastructure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The neighborhood features diverse assets including educational institutions, cultural venues, office spaces, creative workshops, food production facilities, and community recreation areas. Key stakeholders in this expansion include business owners in the expansion area, nearby residents, visitors (primarily from within the city), LIC Partnership operation officials, municipal departments, and potential investors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Data analysis of the area reveals significant foot traffic patterns along major corridors, with pedestrian density simulations highlighting key intersection points that would benefit from activation. The expansion builds upon LIC’s established identity as a cultural hotspot with numerous galleries, museums, and performance spaces that have transformed the neighborhood from its industrial roots into a vibrant arts destination.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"transformation-analysis\">Transformation Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>The transformation strategy for the LIC BID expansion area builds on successful models already proven in the other part of LIC, particularly drawing inspiration from Culture Lab LIC. This cultural hub transformed a once-industrial block into a vibrant community center, demonstrating how temporary venues can establish lasting identity and activity. Culture Lab LIC serves as a scalable model for cultural infrastructure, attracting over 1,000 attendees per weekend, generating $785K+ in annual revenue, supporting 20+ artist residencies yearly, and maintaining 30+ community partnerships.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drawing from the successful experience in LIC, our proposed intervention format centers around pop-up events—temporary, multi-functional public spaces (street corners and parking lots) strategically located in underutilized areas. These pop-ups offer several advantages: they are pilot-friendly and easy to iterate, temporary by design, low-risk yet high-impact, and serve as bridges to future planning by opening pathways for long-term interventions without requiring permanent infrastructure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An innovative “LIC BID Pop-up Event Location Selection Tool” has been developed using path-based multi-criteria decision analysis to identify optimal parking lot locations for these events. The tool evaluates 54 potential parking lots based on subway accessibility, housing proximity, biking infrastructure, POI proximity, and traffic flow, creating a comprehensive scoring system that optimizes for community impact.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The transformation combines “hard” and “soft” system elements. The hard system includes building physical pop-up cultural and market plazas featuring local art installations, food truck areas, live performances, and interactive wayfinding. The soft system provides digital and institutional support through website promotion, social media engagement, and the integration of an existing LIC Community E-Gift Card program that connects over 100 participating businesses.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"prediction-analysis\">Prediction Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>To understand the potential impacts of our pop-up interventions, we analyzed two key scenarios: a mini market featuring local food and crafts, and an art installation designed to encourage walkability and increase dwell time in the area. Our analysis shows that each intervention creates different but complementary impacts. The mini market generates peak activity during lunch hours, with visitors staying 8-12 minutes on average and spending approximately $15-25 per visit. Meanwhile, art installations attract after-work crowds and weekend family visits, with shorter dwell times but contribute to area awareness through social media engagement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These immediate effects cascade into broader impacts. Immediately after visiting, awareness of the area begins to grow through multiple channels – from new social media followers and newsletter signups to geo-tagged posts and community survey responses. This digital engagement has already generated 40% year-over-year growth on Instagram for similar initiatives. The pop-up economy creates several economic benefits: boosting nearby retail revenue, providing direct income for vendors, creating spillover sales for permanent businesses, potential job creation in both temporary and permanent roles, and opportunities to link with grant programs for long-term support. Market research indicates that while the monthly rent for retail space averages $24.92 per square foot in the area, these temporary activations can operate for just 3-14 days while creating outsized impact.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By activating these spaces, the pop-up events will increase foot traffic, participation and engagement, boost local business revenue, create economic impact through job creation and tax revenue, enhance perceived safety, and strengthen neighborhood identity. This data-driven approach ensures targeted interventions that maximize return on investment while building community support for the expansion initiative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"consensus-analysis\">Consensus Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Our consensus-building approach creates a collaborative framework where stakeholders with diverse interests work together toward shared goals through transparent processes, inclusive participation, and iterative refinement that adapts to changing conditions and feedback. This process recognizes that different stakeholders have varying interests, influence, and preferred communication methods, requiring tailored engagement strategies. For groups like local business owners and residents, we employ accessible methods including community workshops, social media engagement, and direct participation in pop-up events.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our multi-channel strategy utilizes both active input methods (interviews, workshops, comments, feedback forms) and passive data collection (foot traffic analysis, social media engagement, participation metrics, economic data, platform analytics) to create a comprehensive understanding of what stakeholders both say they want and how they actually behave when interventions are implemented.

Established in 2007, the BID supports local businesses in an area known for its distinctive architectural character, winding streets, and vibrant mix of shops, restaurants, and cultural venues. The district encompasses several blocks of primarily commercial streets within the larger West Village neighborhood.\r\n\r\n# Insight Analysis\r\n\r\n## West Village BID - Insight\r\n\r\nWest Village BID, established in 2022, is the fourth newest business improvement district in New York City. Covering approximately 46 acres (0.07 square miles), it is relatively small compared to other major city districts. With a moderate annual budget of around $595,000, the BID mainly focuses on providing essential services such as sanitation and public safety. Situated within the historic Greenwich Village Historic District, an area celebrated for its rich cultural and architectural legacy, West Village BID is surrounded by older, well-established BIDs like the Village Alliance (founded in 1993) and the Union Square Partnership (founded in 1984).\r\n\r\n### Key Observations\r\n\r\n-   **Land Use**: Predominantly mixed residential and commercial buildings, with higher density toward the north.\r\n-   **Mobility**: 7th Avenue South serves as a major traffic corridor, while Bleecker Street and Christopher Street are more pedestrian-focused.\r\n-   **Public Spaces**: Parks like Father Demo Square and the Stonewall National Monument serve as important community spaces.\r\n\r\n### Challenges Identified\r\n\r\n-   **Sanitation**: Garbage pickup was reduced during the pandemic and has only recently returned to pre-pandemic levels; maintaining cleanliness remains a priority.\r\n-   **Pedestrian Experience**: Narrow sidewalks in parts of the district combined with heavy foot traffic pose challenges for walkability.\r\n-   **Business Dynamics**: Restaurants, boutique shops, and cultural venues experience varying levels of activity, with concerns related to safety and sanitation expressed during interviews.\r\n\r\n# Transformation Analysis\r\n\r\n## West Village BID - Transformation\r\n\r\nWest Village’s historic streets are struggling to accommodate today’s pedestrian volumes, commercial churn, and tourist pressure. Targeted sidewalk widening and heritage-styled streetscape upgrades directly tackle current issues, restoring safe pedestrian flow, reinforcing the area’s cultural identity​​. Through these interventions, we’re shaping a future that respects the past while supporting local businesses and the community.\r\n\r\n### Current State\r\n\r\n-   **Narrow Sidewalk**: on Bleecker street, queues outside storefronts + two-sided parking cut pedestrian level-of-service.\r\n-   **Limited Rest Area**: lacks pedestrian-friendly elements (e.g. benches)\r\n-   **Fragmented streetscape language**: mix of modern fixtures next to landmark façades undermines sense of place\r\n\r\n### Interventions\r\n\r\n-   **Removing parking space**: provide more space for pedestrain\r\n-   **Pavement expansion**: provide more space for walking, accessibility, and outdoor seating and will have more foot traffic & higher retail engagement\r\n-   **Adding historically inspired design elements**: like historic barriers, retro-style streetlights, and vintage benches to create a historical and attractive environment for both residents and visitors\r\n\r\n### Estimate Cost\r\n\r\n| Element                    | Estimated Cost per Unit     | Total Units (Approx.) | Total Cost Estimate       |\r\n| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |\r\n| Vintage Bench              | \\$2,000 – \\$4,000 per bench | ~5 – 8                | ~\\$10,000 – \\$32,000      |\r\n| Historic Barrier           | \\$500 – \\$1,500 per section | ~8 – 12               | ~\\$4,000 – \\$18,000       |\r\n| Retro Streetlight          | \\$2,000 – \\$8,000 per light | ~3 – 5                | ~\\$6,000 – \\$40,000       |\r\n| Installation Costs         | \\$500 – \\$5,000 per element | –                     | ~\\$4,000 – \\$40,000       |\r\n| Permitting & Misc.         | Varies (5–10 % of project)  | –                     | ~\\$3,000 – \\$10,000       |\r\n| **Total Estimated Budget** | –                           | –                     | **~\\$30,000 – \\$110,000** |\r\n\r\n### Estimate Timeline\r\n\r\n| Phase                        | Time                |               |\r\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Design & Planning            | 1 – 2 months        | Month 0 – 2   |\r\n| Permitting & Approvals       | 2 – 4 months        | Month 2 – 6   |\r\n| Procurement & Manufacturing  | 3 – 6 months        | Month 6 – 12  |\r\n| Installation                 | 1 – 2 months        | Month 12 – 14 |\r\n| **Total Estimated Timeline** | **≈ 7 – 14 months** |               |\r\n\r\n### Estimate Impact\r\n\r\n|               | Walkability Intervention (Phase 1)                                                                   | Aesthetic Intervention (Phase 2)                                                 |\r\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| **Cost**      | Low (trial run)                                                                                      | Moderate                                                                         |\r\n| **Trade-off** | Loss of parking may inconvenience visitors and residents who rely on cars                            | Long-term maintenance costs to keep the elements in good condition               |\r\n| **Impact**    | More space for walking, accessibility, and outdoor seating → higher foot traffic & retail engagement | More historical and attractive environment → increased visitors & local commerce |\r\n| **Summary**   | Prioritizing long-term pedestrian and business benefits                                              | Prioritizing historical enhancement                                              |\r\n\r\n### Challenges and Strategies\r\n\r\n-   **Funding**\r\n    -   Public grants (historical preservation funds), private donors, and BID budgets\r\n    -   Start with a trial project on a high-foot-traffic street, then expand based on success\r\n    -   Consider public-private partnerships\r\n-   **Permitting and Landmark Regulations**\r\n    -   Work closely with city agencies (Landmarks Preservation Commission, NYC DOT) to ensure compliance\r\n    -   Use historically accurate designs to gain faster approval\r\n-   **Construction Disruptions**\r\n    -   Schedule construction during low-traffic seasons to minimize disruptions\r\n    -   Provide temporary pedestrian paths to maintain accessibility\r\n    -   Offer business relief programs, such as temporary outdoor vending permits\r\n\r\n# Prediction Analysis\r\n\r\n## Streetscape Visualization\r\n\r\nTo visualize our proposed streetscape transformations, we developed [Stable Diffusion Street](https://github.com/ethan-yz-hao/stable-diffusion-street), an AI-powered street view image generator. This tool allows us to transform existing West Village street scenes while preserving their distinctive architectural character and spatial layout.\r\n\r\nThe tool offers several key features that were essential for our visualization process:\r\n\r\n1. **Map & Image Acquisition**:\r\n\r\n    - Interactive Map Interface for navigating and selecting West Village locations\r\n    - Street View Capture functionality to directly capture representative street scenes\r\n    - Image Upload capability for incorporating our own street photography\r\n\r\n2. **Image Processing**:\r\n\r\n    - Semantic Segmentation to automatically identify sidewalks, roads, buildings, and other urban elements\r\n    - Structure-Preserving Editing to maintain the original street layout while implementing changes\r\n\r\n3. **Editing Tools**:\r\n\r\n    - Segmentation Editing through ControlNet to modify specific elements like sidewalk width\r\n    - Preservation Masking to protect the West Village's iconic architectural facades\r\n\r\n4. **Generation**:\r\n    - Text-Prompt Generation to transform scenes based on our design specifications (e.g., \"historic street furniture,\" \"vintage lighting\")\r\n\r\nUsing these features, we created before-and-after visualizations that demonstrate how our proposed interventions would enhance the pedestrian experience while respecting the neighborhood's historic character. The visualizations clearly illustrate the potential improvements in walkability, aesthetic cohesion, and public space utilization that align with our transformation goals.\r\n\r\n## Walkability Analysis\r\n\r\nTo analyze and visualize the impact of our proposed sidewalk widening interventions, we developed an [Interactive Sidewalk Width Analysis Tool](https://github.com/ethan-yz-hao/interactive-city-planning) specifically for the West Village BID. This tool allows stakeholders to explore how changes to sidewalk dimensions affect pedestrian density and comfort throughout different times of day.\r\n\r\nThe tool provides several key analytical capabilities:\r\n\r\n1. **Time-Based Pedestrian Density Visualization**:\r\n\r\n    - Morning (9 AM), midday (12 PM), and evening (7 PM) pedestrian traffic patterns\r\n    - Color-coded density indicators showing areas of potential congestion\r\n    - Hexagon aggregation view for broader density analysis\r\n\r\n2. **Interactive Width Adjustment**:\r\n\r\n    - Select individual sidewalk segments for targeted analysis\r\n    - Adjust sidewalk widths using an intuitive slider interface\r\n    - Real-time calculation of pedestrian density metrics\r\n\r\n3. **Data-Driven Decision Support**:\r\n    - Quantitative metrics showing before/after comparisons\r\n    - Identification of high-priority segments based on current pedestrian density\r\n    - Visualization of potential bottlenecks during peak hours\r\n\r\nThe analysis tool integrates actual pedestrian count data with spatial measurements of the existing streetscape, providing an evidence-based approach to our proposed interventions. This data-driven methodology ensures that our recommendations target the areas with the greatest need and potential impact.\r\n\r\n## Walkability Simulation\r\nWe have implemented a tool using the **GAMA platform** to simulate and visualize the effects of adding resting areas in the West Village BID. The goal is to enhance pedestrian walkability, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those with mobility limitations.\r\n\r\nGAMA enables us to model real-world pedestrian behavior through agent-based simulation. Each pedestrian agent is programmed with behaviors such as:\r\n- Walking forward\r\n- Slowing down when crowded\r\n- Seeking rest when fatigued\r\n\r\nWe developed two simulation scenarios:\r\n- **Baseline**: Pedestrians move through the BID under existing conditions, with limited access to seating.\r\n- **Intervention**: Additional benches are installed throughout the area, offering more opportunities for pedestrians to rest.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the two simulations, we observed a reduction in pedestrian fatigue and a more even distribution of foot traffic in the intervention case. This demonstrates that even small design interventions can improve urban comfort and accessibility.\r\n\r\n### Before Intervention\r\n![](/components/groups/west-village/rest-area_before.gif)  \r\n*Baseline scenario: Pedestrians move without added benches. Red tiredness indicators cluster in key areas lacking rest infrastructure.*\r\n\r\n### After Intervention\r\n![](/components/groups/west-village/rest-area_after.gif)  \r\n*Intervention scenario: With benches added, tiredness indicators decrease and spread out, showing improved pedestrian recovery and comfort.*\r\n\r\n### Tiredness Levels Visualization\r\n*Dot colors represent tiredness levels:  \r\n🟢 Green = Energetic  \r\n🟡 Yellow = Moderately Tired  \r\n🔴 Red = Very Tired / Needs Rest*\r\n\r\nIn the baseline simulation, red clusters indicate pedestrian fatigue due to the lack of rest areas. In the intervention scenario, those red zones begin to fade — signaling a more walkable and supportive environment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Interactive Scenario Planning\r\n\r\nIn addition to visualizing fatigue patterns, our GAMA model serves as an interactive **planning tool**. Decision-makers can:\r\n- Adjust the number and location of resting areas\r\n- Explore multiple design configurations\r\n- Observe how pedestrian flow and comfort levels shift in response\r\n\r\nThis enables low-risk exploration of **“what-if” scenarios**, supporting smarter, data-driven design decisions before implementation begins.\r\n\r\n## Aesthetic Elements Visualization with InCitu\r\n\r\nRevitalizing a neighborhood isn’t only about adding infrastructure — it's about restoring a sense of place. To support our walkability interventions, we used **InCitu**, an augmented reality (AR) platform, to visualize aesthetic improvements directly within the West Village streetscape.\r\n\r\nInCitu allows us to overlay **vintage-inspired urban elements** onto real-world street views using a mobile device. These AR renderings help stakeholders and community members preview how historic features can enhance the pedestrian experience.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Aesthetic Interventions:\r\n- [**Decorative iron barrier**](https://app.incitu.us/project/?id=irjdssen)  \r\n- [**Retro-style streetlamp**](https://app.incitu.us/project/?id=zd0nqbph)  \r\n- [**Classic bench design**](https://app.incitu.us/project/?id=n92ntojo)  \r\n\r\nThese elements are more than just upgrades — they evoke the rich cultural history of the neighborhood and encourage passersby to slow down, observe, and enjoy their surroundings.\r\n\r\n### On-Site Visualization\r\n![](/components/groups/west-village/incitu_visualization.png)  \r\n*Vintage design elements — including barriers, lighting, and benches — rendered at full scale in their future locations using InCitu.*\r\n\r\n### Real-Time Decision Support\r\n\r\nInCitu turns aesthetic planning into an interactive, immersive experience. Stakeholders can:\r\n- **Place, resize, and rotate elements** in context\r\n- **Visualize designs at street level** before implementation\r\n- **Engage in collaborative decision-making** without needing design expertise\r\n\r\nBy making proposed changes feel real, InCitu helps bridge the gap between concept and consensus. This tool supports a more inclusive design process and ensures our streetscape interventions are not just functional, but meaningful.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Economic Impact\r\n\r\n### Business Activities\r\n\r\nThere are some BID made similar improvements. In Brooklyn's Dumbo section, the retail sales jumped **172%** three years after the first pedestrian plaza opened. On Pearl Street, sales during peak seasons increased **14%** in stores along a mini plaza. Open Streets corridors provided an averaging **19%** sales boost for restaurants and bars.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the interventions should also lead to a **20%** increase in business activities.\r\n\r\n### Employment Opportunities\r\n\r\nLong-Term Growth in Tourism will create more Employment Opportunities and increasing the local economy. Restaurants, retail shops, guided tours, and artisan markets need more staff to run the business.\r\nBased on **20%** increase, this is estimate increase of job opportunities.\r\n\r\n|                     | Current Employment | Predicted Employment (Post-Intervention) | Net Gain |\r\n| ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |\r\n| Cafés & Restaurants | 150                | 180                                      | +30      |\r\n| Retail Shops        | 50                 | 60                                       | +10      |\r\n| Guided Tours        | 10                 | 15                                       | +5       |\r\n| Artisan Markets     | 8                  | 12                                       | +4       |\r\n\r\n# Consensus Analysis\r\n\r\n- **Strategy for Public Engagement**\r\n Because successful urban interventions hinge on community buy-in, we devised a multi-pronged public engagement strategy. It included open workshops, online surveys, and pop-up installations. The aim was to gather input from residents, business owners, and visitors early and often—ensuring that design decisions reflect local needs.\r\n- **Communication Between Agents**\r\n In our agent-based models, we conceptualized city stakeholders (municipal authorities, the BID board, residents, merchants) as distinct “agents” with unique interests. We then established communication channels—public forums, newsletters, neighborhood apps—to facilitate dialogue. This real-time feedback loop allowed quick adaptation of proposals, reducing friction between parties with differing priorities.\r\n- **Collaborative Decision Process**\r\n Finally, we proposed an ongoing collaborative framework wherein data-driven simulations, AR visualization tools, and community input converge to guide final decisions. By layering insights, transformations, and predictions in one shared platform, all parties can weigh in on trade-offs and refine proposals. This cyclical, consensus-focused process aims to produce more inclusive, lasting outcomes for the West Village BID.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n-   [West Village BID Website](https://westvillagebid.org/)\r\n-   [Annual Report (PDF)](https://westvillagebid.org/annual-reports/)\r\n-   [NYC Small Business Services - BID Directory](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/neighborhoods/business-improvement-districts.page)","src/content/projects/west-village.md",[48],"7f04f19ff19bc3ac",{"html":301,"metadata":302},"\u003Cp>The West Village Business Improvement District serves one of Manhattan’s most iconic and historic neighborhoods.
