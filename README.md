# BIDSpec Project Website

This is the official website for the BIDSpec (Business Improvement District) project from Cornell Tech. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), the site showcases our research on Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and their impact on urban development and community engagement.

## About BIDSpec

BIDSpec is a comprehensive analysis platform for Business Improvement Districts, providing insights into how these special assessment districts function, their economic impact, and their role in urban development. The project combines geospatial data visualization, economic analysis, and policy research to create a holistic understanding of BIDs across various cities.
