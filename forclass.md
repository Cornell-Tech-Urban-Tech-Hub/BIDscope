# April 16 2025 - Website Dev Workshop 
## https://cornell-tech-urban-tech-hub.github.io/BIDspec/

## 10:30-11AM 
### Break into teams, and flesh out an outline for your BIDSpec page: 
- Text for your insights 
- Text for your transformations 
- Text for your predictions 
- Text for your transformations. 
- AT MINIMUM, one interactive visualization. Ideally code, but if there are server-side constraints, a video will suffice. 
- And then, also include supplemental multimedia (images, etc.) 

## 11AM 
### I will go around and review the outlines of the website page for each group. 

## 11:50-12:00 Break 

## 12:00-class end
### We will workshop getting components working in the project environment. Let's save text for outside of class, as it should be a fairly easy port of your final slide deck.
